# Hello World Project - 7th Grade Computer Science

## About This Project

Welcome to my "Hello World" project! This is part of my 7th-grade Computer Science learning journey. In this project, I've been experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dive into the world of web programming.

## Project Goals

- **Learning HTML:** I've created the basic structure of a webpage using HTML, including essential tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`. This formed the foundation of my project.

- **Exploring CSS:** By working with CSS, I've added style and flair to my webpage. I've played around with properties like `background-color`, `font-family`, and `margin` to give my webpage a unique look.

- **Dabbling in JavaScript:** To make my webpage interactive, I've incorporated JavaScript. I started with a simple function that changes the text color of an element when clicked, giving me a taste of JavaScript's capabilities.

## My Learning Journey

Throughout this project, I've learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create dynamic and engaging web content. I've also discovered the joy of problem-solving and creative expression that coding offers.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue expanding my web programming skills. I plan to explore more complex interactions using JavaScript, learn about responsive design with CSS, and eventually build more sophisticated web projects.

## Viewing My Webpage

To view my webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. If you're interested in the code, feel free to explore the `styles.css` and `script.js` files as well.

## Connect with Me

If you're also interested in coding, web development, or just want to chat, feel free to connect with me. Let's learn and grow together in the world of technology!

Happy coding! üöÄüåêüë©‚Äçüíª
